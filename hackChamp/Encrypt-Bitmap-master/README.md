Encrypt!
===================


Hey! I wrote a project for encrypting a text into bitmap file that human eye cannot recognize that. this program using a cool algorithm that showed below.

----------
## Note: ##
it was one of my first project in c++ and I didn't use classes and object oriented at all! 

it has not make file eighter and it just including one file.

## Algorithm ##
**encrypting :** 
1. read bitmap
2. seperate picture into 8*8 squares and calculate variance of any RGB colors
3. get message from user
4. get key from user and make a random string using that key belong seed 
5. for every square :

a. choose one square using random seed

b. change LSB of pixel that choosed

c. repeat 5 until message ends

and save bitmap


**decrypting :**
1. read bitmap
2. seperate picture into 8*8 squares and calculate variance of any RGB colors
3. get key from user and make a random string using that key belong seed 
4. . for every square :
    
a. choose one square using random seed

b. read LSB and adding to string 

c. repeat 4 until seeing \n

and save message into disk.

How to use?
-------------


#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Input and Output

first line encrypt
second line bitmap file name
third line is your key
forth line Is your message
```
encrypt
image.bmp
2132
I like pizza !
```
first line decrypt for decrypting
second line bitmap file name
third line is your key
```
decrypt
coded-image.bmp
21211
```
***Note :*** bitmap should be in program repository.
